# git-cleaner

A simple lifecycle utility to clean all local git branches whose remote have already been deleted. 

## Install

2. Execute ``./loader.sh``

You should be able to execute ``git-cleaner`` within any git repo now.

## Permissions

The scripts should have UNIX-style 755 (-rwx-r-x-r-x) permissions.
